# RedemptionUnity

Porting Vampire the Masquerade: Redemption to Unity

This is a work in progress repository of it, currently the barebones for model formats were worked on.

You will need an original copy of the game installed, and have the model files extracted within the Unity project folder. In the future we'll add NOB archive support and loading them from the original game's path.

## Setup Instructions

Before opening the project you'll need to have the latest Unity version installed (Unity 5.1.1p2).

## Future Features

- NOB archive importing
- NIL level loading in runtime
- Finish NOD model importing with animation support (NAD)
- Implement basic game mechanism once all formats are working
